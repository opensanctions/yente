# Candidate Generation Benchmark

Benchmarks candidate generation performance across different matching algorithms using synthetic person data.

## Fixtures

- `negatives_*` fixtures are generated by the https://github.com/opensanctions/qarin/tree/main/screening-fixtures.
- `positives_un_*` are generated from the `un_sc_sanctions` dataset. They exist in a treated version, with some minor typos and other reshuffles applied to the names.
- `positives_us_congress` is generated from the `us_congress` dataset. There are a lot of names that are common in the US, making this fixture a good one to test candidate generation for tricky cases.

## Command Line Options

- `--person-file`: CSV file(s) containing PersonRecord data (can specify multiple)
- `--matchers`: Algorithm names to use for matching (can specify multiple)
- `--dataset`: Dataset to use for matching (default: "sanctions")

## Run Example

```bash
python contrib/candidate_generation_benchmark/benchmark.py \
    --person-file contrib/candidate_generation_benchmark/fixtures/people_us.csv \
    --person-file contrib/candidate_generation_benchmark/fixtures/people_global.csv \
    --matchers logic-v2 \
    --matchers logic-v1
```
